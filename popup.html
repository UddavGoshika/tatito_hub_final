  Software is a generic term for applications, scripts, and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part. System software is a type of computer program that runs a computer's hardware and application programs. The operating system is a well-known example of system software. Software tools are computer programs that developers use to create, maintain, debug, or support other applications and programs. Information technology software means any representation of instructions, data, sound or image, including source code and object code, recorded in a machine readable form, and capable of being manipulated or providing interactivity to a user, by means of a computer or an automatic data processing machine or any other.</p>

  <h2>How Does Software Work?</h2>
  <p>Basically, when you install a program onto your computer or device it has instructions on what needs to be done for the program to run correctly. When these instructions are followed by your computer or device it is known as "executing" the code.<br><br>
  A software or a programming tool is a set of computer programs that are used by the developers to create, maintain, debug, or support other applications and programs. Software development tools are simply tools (generally software themselves) that programmers practice to create other software.<br><br>
  A general term covering the development methods, programming languages, and tools to support them that may be used in the development of software. From: software technology in A Dictionary of Computing » Subjects: Science and technology — Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

  PHP is known for being simple, fast, and flexible. It's also easy for beginners to learn, but offers advanced features for more experienced programmers.<br><br>
  PHP is used to create dynamic content, interact with databases, and customize websites.<br><br>
  PHP originally stood for “personal home page”, but is now a recursive acronym for “hypertext preprocessor database integration. PHP is object-oriented, case-sensitive, and platform independent. It's compatible with many Apache and IIS servers, and runs on Windows, Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>

  <p class="subtitle">Personality Development & Communication Skills</p>

  <h2>Personality Development</h2>
  <p>Personality development is the process of developing and improving one's personality traits, thoughts, and behaviors. It can help people build their identity, improve their communication skills, and gain confidence and self-esteem.</p>

  <h3>Key Tips</h3>
  <p>Smile a lot<br>
  Think positive<br>
  Dress sensibly<br>
  Be soft-spoken<br>
  Leave your ego behind<br>
  Avoid backbiting — backstabbing and criticizing people are negative traits which work against an individual's personality<br>
  Help others<br>
  Build confidence<br>
  Be a patient listener<br>
  Master interview skills</p>

  <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
  <p>Effective communication skills play a crucial role in honing one's personality. Communication helps express yourself in the most convincing way. Your thoughts, feelings, and knowledge should be passed on in the most desirable manner, and effective communication skills help you achieve the same.</p>

  <h3>1. Smile a Lot</h3>
  <p>Smiling a lot can mean that someone is very pleased or happy about something (e.g., “He was beaming from ear to ear”). Smiling can also mean to feel positive about someone or something, or to treat them positively (e.g., “The government began to smile on small businesses”).<br><br>
  Benefits include:<br><br>
  Happiness: People who smile often tend to be happier and more energetic<br>
  Health: Smiling improves cardiovascular health by increasing blood flow to the brain and lowering blood pressure<br>
  Dateability: Smiling can make you more dateable</p>

  <h3>2. Think Positive</h3>
  <p>“Thinking positive” means having an optimistic attitude and focusing on the good in any situation. It’s about approaching life's challenges with hope rather than assuming the worst.<br><br>
  Positive thinking impacts physical and mental health by helping you:<br><br>
  Cope with stress and hardships<br>
  Think more creatively<br>
  Solve problems better<br>
  Form positive relationships<br>
  Improve pain tolerance<br>
  Boost your immune system<br><br>
  Tips for a positive mindset:<br><br>
  Take control of what you can change<br>
  Accept what you can’t change<br>
  Go easy on yourself<br>
  Pay attention to your diet<br>
  Embrace change<br>
  Step outside your comfort zone</p>

  <h3>3. Dress Sensibly</h3>
  <p>“Dress sensibly” means wearing clothes that are practical and suitable for the purpose, rather than just fashionable. “Dress sense” is the ability to choose clothes that look attractive and suit you, making any combination appear fashionable and appealing.</p>

  <h3>4. Be Soft-Spoken</h3>
  <p>Having a gentle, quiet voice or manner. A soft-spoken approach combines calmness with clarity, making communication more effective and respectful.</p>

  <h3>5. Leave Your Ego Behind</h3>
  <p>“Leave your ego behind” means checking your sense of self-importance before entering a situation or conversation — letting go of the need to be right, in control, or recognized.<br><br>
  Tips:<br><br>
  Be open to changing your opinions<br>
  Assume good intentions<br>
  Pause before going defensive<br>
  Ask questions<br>
  Remember you are smarter today than yesterday<br><br>
  Letting go of ego makes you more open, curious, humble, and willing to learn from others.</p>

  <h3>6. Avoid Backbiting</h3>
  <p>Backbiting is saying unkind or mean things about someone who is not present (also known as tale-bearing). Synonyms: slander, abuse, spite, gossip.<br><br>
  Tips to avoid:<br><br>
  Don’t say behind someone’s back what you wouldn’t say to their face<br>
  Mind your own business<br>
  Be trustworthy<br>
  Understand everyone is struggling<br>
  Disengage from gossip</p>

  <h3>7. Help Others</h3>
  <p>“Help” means providing what someone needs to accomplish a task or satisfy a need. Synonyms: aid, assist, support, encourage, facilitate, back, promote, bolster, abet, guide.</p>

  <h3>8. Confidence</h3>
  <p>Confidence is a feeling of reliance on one’s powers or circumstances — faith that one will act rightly and effectively. It includes trust, certainty, intimacy, and support.</p>

  <h3>9. A Patient Listener</h3>
  <p>A patient listener gives full attention to understand rather than respond.<br><br>
  Qualities:<br><br>
  Doesn’t fill silences with own thoughts<br>
  Listens to understand, not to reply<br>
  Avoids abrupt subject changes<br><br>
  Important in building trust, especially in professional settings like healthcare.</p>

  <h3>10. Interview Skills</h3>
  <p>Interview skills help job seekers stand out and demonstrate they are the best candidate.<br><br>
  Key skills:<br><br>
  Active listening<br>
  Confidence<br>
  Flexibility<br>
  Clear communication<br>
  Positive body language (eye contact, smiling, composure)<br>
  Dress appropriately<br><br>
  Importance:<br><br>
  Validate resume claims<br>
  Make a great first impression<br>
  Show team value<br>
  Highlight accomplishments</p>

  <p class="subtitle">Engineering Project Documentation</p>

  <p>The quality of the design and documentation produced has a major influence on the overall performance and efficiency of production projects. Designers provide the basic blueprints for representing the ideas and concepts that manufacturers need to make products a reality.<br><br>
  However, it is the quality of the documentation provided which determines how effective and efficient turnaround time is for production. Inadequate and deficient design and documentation impacts the production process efficiency by leading to delays, rework and variations, contributing to increases in project time and cost.<br><br>
  There are countless types of documentation used throughout every company, ranging from quality assurance to manufacturing. The main categories are:</p>

  <h3>Main Categories</h3>
  <p>Management documentation<br>
  Quality assurance<br>
  Engineering documentation<br>
  Fabrication, Assembly, Test, and Installation documents</p>

  <h3>Management Documentation</h3>
  <p>Management documentation is the process of managing and controlling an organization's documents, including their creation, modification, approval, and accessibility. Document management can be done manually or with a document management system (DMS).<br><br>
  A DMS helps organizations:<br><br>
  Increase transparency: Ensure everyone works with the same information<br>
  Securely share content: Store documents securely and share for limited time<br>
  Mitigate risk: Keep key technical information available even when employees leave<br>
  Improve sales: Capture leads with web forms and store sales/marketing material<br><br>
  Key features of a DMS:<br><br>
  Security: Access control and editing rights<br>
  Storage: Virtually unlimited space<br>
  Search and retrieval: Easy indexing<br>
  Collaboration: Multiple users working simultaneously<br>
  Version control: Monitor changes and validity over time</p>

  <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
  <p>Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements. QA establishes and maintains set requirements for developing or manufacturing reliable products.<br><br>
  Key methods:<br><br>
  Failure testing: Continually tests products under stress (heat, pressure, vibration for physical; high load for software)<br>
  Statistical process control (SPC): Uses statistical methods to manage and control production<br>
  Total quality management (TQM): Applies quantitative methods for continuous improvement based on facts, data, and analysis</p>

  <h3>Engineering Documentation</h3>
  <p>Engineering documentation is a detailed record of a product’s design, development, and implementation process. It includes:<br><br>
  Design specifications<br>
  Technical drawings and schematics<br>
  Calculations and analysis reports<br>
  Test plans and results<br>
  Material lists and sourcing information<br><br>
  It is used to justify development, describe required work, maintain/enhance software, communicate ideas, ensure quality/consistency, and comply with standards and regulations.</p>

  <h3>Fabrication</h3>
  <p>Fabrication is the act of making a product from raw materials using processes to create component parts for products or structures. Manufacturing is the processing of raw materials into a finished product.</p>

  <h3>Assembly</h3>
  <p>Assembly documentation provides detailed instructions for assembling a product, including:<br><br>
  Assembly drawings with leader lines, notes, material tables, step numbers<br>
  Design specifications<br>
  Calculations and analysis reports<br>
  Test plans and results<br>
  Material lists and sourcing information<br><br>
  Engineering documentation helps communicate ideas, ensure quality/consistency, and comply with standards.</p>

  <h3>Test</h3>
  <p>Documentation testing ensures a digital product’s functionality matches its documentation. Benefits include:<br><br>
  Clarity in team roles and objectives<br>
  Tracking project requirements and test coverage<br>
  Real-time feedback for plan adjustments<br>
  Reduced risk by identifying issues early</p>

  <h3>Installation Documents</h3>
  <p>Installation testing ensures end users can install software components without issues. Checks include:<br><br>
  Correct installation folder<br>
  User choice of default folder<br>
  Proper display of installer instructions<br>
  Ease of internet installation<br>
  Sufficient disk space</p>
